### question 1:  could you explain how the algorithm you present there will help 1kVP validators when been backed by nominators? is the goal for this algorithm to be added on Apps? and if yes: is this algorithm used when you enable the 1kVP validators filters on targgets?

我們希望藉由在Polkadot App上能夠有一個明顯的1kv提名的入口 增加1kv validator被提名的機會 那目前1kv有兩百多個運行中的節點 怎麼選擇要提名那些節點就會是個議題 例如怎樣能夠讓每個節點能夠公平的被提名
怎樣能夠讓提名人能夠獲得合理的收益以鼓勵他使用1kv的入口來提名  因此我們提出幾種可能的算法 實作在1kv的提名功能內 之後也可以依據實際的成果獲回饋再進一步改善

### question 2: are you also proposing in the document to build a dashboard for 1kVP validators based on the existing one? (this is the data analysis subtitle)

是的 目前1kv的dashboard的面向是給"validator"查看節點的狀態 我們希望能夠實作一個dashboard面向"提名人"讓提名人能夠從中判斷他比較想要提名那些節點

### question 3: the cost of man per week to 1500 USD for a part-time involvement seems quite high to me, especially for project managers.

### question 4: stage 1.1 discussion and design: i have the feeling all of this discussion should happen before the proposal is funded: if the conclusion of the discussion is positive, then you can move to the development part. If not, then the project does not seem plausible: i am not sure if the council should be funding exploratory milestones to confirm the plausibility of a project. This should already be confirmed, since you re proposing a solution already.

我同意把discussion算到fund內很怪

### question 5: I dont understand what the deliverable is on stage 1.4

我們希望能夠藉由這個計畫的成果提出一份建議給web3跟1kv雙方 讓1kv的提名機制能夠更有效率

### question 6: server fees: will this servers be used during development of the proposal? how will you cover maintenance of servers after?

我個人希望這個server能夠被我們長期維護
