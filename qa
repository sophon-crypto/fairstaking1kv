## Question 1:   you mentioned that at current prices, only a few operators are able to set up and maintain validators: how would you answer to the statement that a higher price ensures that economically speaking, operatora and validators pay more attention to their setups, increasing the overall security of the network?

Answer: the higher price means the higher payback by FIAT Currency so the operator will pay more attention to their node because the stablity could affect the daily commision. So the operator could think of many methods to gurantee the stability. I am the personal operator and i need to keep the security of node against other hackers. Therefor, i think higher price could increase the overal security of the network. 

## Qeustion 2: in order to establish an "partnership/alliance" with the 1kvp you should first talk to the people in charge at W3F to see if this is possible, before setting this proposal for public discussion.

Answer: The project was proposed for the election rate increasing of 1KV validator by the Apps but finally it is not permitted by the Apps team because of the design idea ( you know that).  So i think if i try to go on this project i need to find some 3rd nominators. So i talked to StaFi team with this idea and they agreed.  So i write the new proposal with the new idea.  But honestly even we don't provide the idea to them they will build their own valiator then get the staking income. We just push them to be closer to 1KVP a little bit. Of course you are right with the future of this project.  The project indeed causes some kind of "partnership/alliance" with the 1KVP if many staking service provider join this project.  Now this project is still limited in small scale. Just very few people to know this.

## Question 3: If i understand the proposal right, an end user (nominator) can stake their KSM on Stafi and your team will choose the validators from the 1kvp pool:

Answer: No, that is not true. My team can't decide which validator could be chosen by StaFi and that is their chocie. My team just provide the api and they will use it directly. We can't get any finacial income by this staking service. We just provide the function support but not service support.  

## Question 4: how would you respond to potential feedback claiming centralization of the staking process via Stafi?

Answer： This is a good question and i think probably we can process the potential attack by partnership/alliance with some rules such as rules when we joined 1KV program. If you think we can build this parnership/alliance i could help to design some rules. In my opinion for the staking service providers they will not nominate all their own to the 1KVP node but the 1KVP node with the strict rules and diversity is a very important supplyment. And they would like to build this relationship, too.For official 1kv team it is better to know how many nodes they would like to use. Ii is really a potential parnership/alliance.

## Question 5： i dont quite understand the function of the 1KV-MST dashboard here, could you extend on this?

Answer: 1KV-MST dashboard is around the staking service in the view of nominators but not operator.  We just care about the information which have effect on the nominating.  But anyway all the 1KV node information is stored as join format what we need to do is use the most suitable display model. And if possible we would like to display who will support this node now.

## Question 6： wouldnt it be the same for users to use the working infrastructure from the 1kvp?

Answer: Yes, it is the working infrastructure from the 1kvp. so i think it is part of 1KV Program. Maybe i missed some your question. If my answer is not not accure please give me more information.

## Question 7： What im trying to understand is: will this project deliver a new dashboard for users that solely want to nominate 1kvp validators? will any of the treasury funds be used for nominating these validators?
Answer: Yes, this dashboard tries to provide more inforamtion for  the nominators to decide which one they would like nominate.  I don't know, is there any rules to forbid treasury funds to nominates these validators?
